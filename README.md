Basic Youtube downloader
========================

Inspired by Sonarr/Radarr, but in PHP as an exercise.

Still very much work in progress, only basic searching and queueing implemented.
Search for youtube videos in playlists, channels or just by url/id.
Choose format and download.

* Requirements
- Laravel 7+
- youtube-dl
